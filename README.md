## Week 1

**New Project Description**:

We have completely changed our idea. We are now building a student database for computer science classes. This will be a database that contains user information and can be updated by incoming students. Information will include things like period, group, name, contact, and more. We will try to find a way to backup the database and explore with different techniques in storing and retrieving the data.
