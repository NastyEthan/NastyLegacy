## Week 0

[Link to review ticket for this week](https://github.com/NastyEthan/NastyLegacy/issues/1)

**New Project Description**:

We have completely changed our idea. We are now building a student database for computer science classes. This will be a database that contains user information and can be updated by incoming students. Information will include things like period, group, name, contact, and more. We will try to find a way to backup the database and explore with different techniques in storing and retrieving the data.

**Roles. These are the same as before. **:

Our sponsor is Mr. Mortensen. We will be designing this database for his use in teaching computer science at Del Norte.

**Old Project Description**:

A utilities website to help users with basic daily tasks. For example, we expect to implement a calculator, password generator/manager, timer, and other features specifically useful to teachers!
