# Project Requirements

## Week 1

### First meeting with Mr. Mortensen

- [Initial Requirements/Ideas are on the linked wiki](https://github.com/NastyLegacy/NastyLegacy/wiki/New-Project-Plans-Ideas-Wires)
* First, we will build an SQL Database
* Establish columns that contain categories like period, group, name, contact
* Page for new students to add in their information. Old students should be able to delete and update their information (and only their own).
* Page for the teacher to view all the data
* Search function so that the teacher can easily find information for a particular student.
* Way to backup the database
* For the future: experimentation with other database types like mongo

## Week 2

### Second meeting with Mr. Mortensen

* Another encryption system/class code type thing so only students actually in the class can update
* For hosting: host personally on AWS for developing for now, but later on Mr. Mortensen's personally pi or AWS will host it
* Have security key to access the API as it has personal information of del norte students
