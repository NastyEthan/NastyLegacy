# Project Requirements

## Week 1

### First meeting with Mr. Mortensen

- [Initial Requirements/Ideas are on the linked wiki](https://github.com/NastyLegacy/NastyLegacy/wiki/New-Project-Plans-Ideas-Wires)
* First, we will build an SQL Database
* Establish columns that contain categories like period, group, name, contact
* Page for new students to add in their information. Old students should be able to delete and update their information (and only their own).
* Page for the teacher to view all the data
* Search function so that the teacher can easily find information for a particular student.
* Way to backup the database
* For the future: experimentation with other database types like mongo
