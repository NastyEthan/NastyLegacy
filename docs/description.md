# Project Overvew

We are building a student database for computer science classes. This will be a database that contains user information and can be updated by incoming students. Information will include things like period, group, name, contact, and more. We will try to find a way to backup the database and explore with different techniques in storing and retrieving the data.

# Licensing 

Our project uses the MIT license. Our project is geared towards being open source, and there is no need for us to have patents. We want our sponsor, Mr. M, to be able to use the software for free; it is unlikely to be used elsewhere. We also want him to be able to use the software and easily make any derivative changes as he sees fit.
