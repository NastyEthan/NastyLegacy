# Our ideas

## Week 2

- Regarding Data: we will be dealing with student data in AP computer science classes. This data must be kept private to all but Mr. M
- Due to the above point, security is needed. We will use either symmetric key or RSA encryption to provide this security for data privacy.
- We will have an admin password that blocks off access to all the student data. Students will only be able to update their own data. This admin password is what will be encrypted.
